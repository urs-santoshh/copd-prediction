# copd-prediction

In this project, we will predict chronic obstructive pulmonay disease.

## Objectives:

- Collect and preprocess data relevant to COPD.
- Identify and engineer significant features contributing to COPD.
- Develop a predictive model to estimate the risk of COPD.
- Evaluate the model's performance and refine it.
- Deploy the model for practical use in a clinical or public health setting.
